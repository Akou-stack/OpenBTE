OpenBTE's documentation
===================================
OpenBTE solves the phonon Boltzmann transport equation in its mean-free-path formulation. Below, we provide info for downloading and getting started.

OpenBTE can be download by simply typing in your shell

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install openbte

Getting started
---------------------------------------

The first step for setting up a OpenBTE simulation is creating a geometry. This can be done by the command

.. code-block:: shell

   openbte -g porous/aligned -sh circle -phi=0.25 -lx=10 -ly=10

where ``porous/aligned`` is the geometry model for a two-dimensional porous material. In this case, the shape of the pore is circular, the porosity is 0.25 and the periodicity is 10 nm in both Cartesian directions. Essentially, we simulate only one pore with periodic boundary conditions. The keywords and relative options for other geometry models are listed in the Reference. Once this command is run, the file ``geometry.hdf5`` is created in the current directory. 

To plot the geometry, type che command

.. code-block:: shell

   openbte -p map/geometry
