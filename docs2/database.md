## Adding your data

If you have published material data and wish to share if with the community, you may want to add an entry to the database above. The database above has the following features:

 - The objected being stored are the `material.h5` files.
 - Data is self-hosted, i.e. you will be providing a link to your file. Currently, we support Google drive's file ids but more platforms are being added.
 - The quality of the data is not endorsed. We only check that all the needed fields of the hdf5 files are correctly populated. 
 - Once launched, OpenBTE will show the user the recommended citations based on the used input data.

The first step in adding your own data is, actually, having published data. If you have high quality data but haven't published it yet, you may want to consider submitting it to [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) first. Once you are ready, please fill this [form](https://forms.gle/Kjhky3wjrrghXBb48).
